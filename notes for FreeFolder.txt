Server for FreeFolder

file can have three states:
	passive
	downloading from client
	sending to client

server - client communication:
	client will check with server if a change has been made
	if the server has a later timestamp for that file than the client, download that file

	client checks it filelist with the servers:
		server has file that client doesnt
			download file from server
		server has recently registered deletion of file
			dialog: "delete file locally or just stop tracking?"
		client is tracking file that server doesnt have yet
			upload file to server
