Server for FreeFolder

file can have three states:
	passive
	downloading from client
	sending to client

server - client communication:
	client will check with server if a change has been made
	if the server has a later timestamp for that file than the client, download that file

	client checks it filelist with the servers:
		server has file that client doesnt
			download file from server
		server has recently registered deletion of file
			dialog: "delete file locally or just stop tracking?"
		client is tracking file that server doesnt have yet
			upload file to server


command types that can be sent client -> server
	check that files are downloaded and are up to date
	download (specified)
	upload files





Server doesnt hold a list of all files at runtime.
Server just holds some simple strings and stuffs to represent a file.
The files themselves aren't loaded to be sent to clients until needed.

	this can be saved some sort of proprietary file. maybe *.sft?
ServerFileTracker {
	# id
	# filepath
	# timestamp
	# last author
	# historyFile (this will be added later)

	File load()
}

Server will hold Map<String id, ServerFileTracker>.

	historyfile will be a compressed file containing a history of filechanges. Basically several versions of the above list.
